3 Phases:
Gathering, Crafting, Vaulting

# Gathering
Gather Resources. Like your typical Clicker Game.
Click a button, increase number of thing.
Eventually you can get ways to do this for you automatically

# Crafting
Use the resources you got from Gathering to make things.
These crafted resources will be used for progression and will eventually be automated

# Vaulting
A timed resource collection. Think of it as an automatic Gathering that you have on a timer.
Needs Vault Rock + Vault Stone to go Vaulting.
These are done autoamtically, and you'll need to hire people to run vaults for you.
These people can have their stats/gear adjusted to make for better gains/survival rates for vaults.
