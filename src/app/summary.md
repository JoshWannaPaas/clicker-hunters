## Outline

3 Phases:
Gathering, Crafting, Vaulting

# Gathering

Gather Resources. Like your typical Clicker Game.
Click a button, increase number of thing..
Eventually you can get ways to do this for you automatically

# Crafting

Use the resources you got from Gathering to make things.
These crafted resources will be used for progression and will eventually be automated

# Vaulting

A timed resource collection. Think of it as an automatic Gathering that you have on a timer.
Needs Vault Rock + Vault Stone (to build a portal?) to go Vaulting.
These are done autoamtically, and you'll need to hire people to run vaults for you.
These people can have their stats/gear adjusted to make for better gains/survival rates for vaults.


## Systems/Mechanics


# Materials

Your inventory is shown on the page at all times and can be hidden if wished.
Every phase of the game will add to your inventory, and some will require to use materials of course.

Break the game's resources into very basic components. Things that compact should just be at their highest tier.
For example, instead of having Raw Chromatic Iron that you need to smelt when you mine it, just get Chromatic Iron (Ingots)
Another example, instead of getting Knowledge Essence that you just need to compact into Knowledge Shards, you just get Knowledge Shards from Vaults

Crafting amounts aren't limited to Minecraft's 3x3 workbench, so values of crafts may be adjusted.
For example, Knowledge Stars are crafted with 8 Knowledge Shards, but since you get Shards from Vaults, you can extend this to something like 100 Shards for a Knowledge Star


# Soul Shards

This is one of two primary currencies in the game. All Vault Materials can be converted to Soul Shards, and technically, this is your overall "worth."
Not sure at the moment, but upgrades might be at the cost of either Materials, Soul Shards, or both.
If I implement Greed Levels as the New Game+/Ascension mechanic, the total amount of Soul Shards after diffusing everything you own will be what determines Greed Level.


# Vault Currency

Instead of diffusing materials, you can sell them at the market for Vault Currency.
Currency comes in the form of Vault Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.
Currency will be used either solely or in combination with materials to do things like purchase items or hire people.
